## 📌 Project Idea
Currently, many people in Gaza rely on Facebook groups to buy and sell. This approach leads to several issues:
* **🔍 Search Inefficiency:** Difficulty finding relevant products.
* **📂 Poor Categorization:** Lack of proper structure.
* **🤝 Trust Issues:** Limited verification between buyers and sellers.

**Locaydo** addresses these issues by providing a centralized hub with categorized products, clear seller profiles, and a simple rating system.
